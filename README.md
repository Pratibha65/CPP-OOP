This is my first project using CPP and Object Oriented Programming.
I have created a student managemnet system which can do the following tasks : 
   1.Add new student
   2.Display all students
   3.Search student
   4.Update students
   5.Delete students
   6.Exit

This file demonstrates a successful implementation of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. It includes encapsulation through the use of private member variables and public getter and setter methods, constructors for initializing objects, and methods for manipulating and displaying student data. The code also incorporates vector manipulation to manage a dynamic list of student objects, showcasing practical use of OOP principles in a real-world scenario.
